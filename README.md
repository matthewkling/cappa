This repo contains source code for the [California Plant Phylodiversity Atlas](http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/phylodiversity) (CAPPA), a web application built with Shiny. The app visualizes modeled data on the biogeography, evolutionary relationships, and local community composition of California's 5220 native plant species. More information on the project is available in the [journal article](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2017.0397) and the associated [data repository](https://github.com/matthewkling/facets-of-phylodiversity).
